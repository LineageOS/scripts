      "message": "Thanks for your input; I understand your perspective. Of course, production keys should never be stored in the scripts folder. In my understanding, this is a template to generate the keys and maintain them separately in a private folder (~/vendor/lineage-priv/keys). I thought ignoring the keys was an extra security step to avoid accidentally leaking them while working on the actual script files. I can abandon this change if it\u0027s not really needed.",
